                        "Ovenbirds breed in large, mature broadleaf or mixed forests from the Mid-Atlantic states to northeastern British Columbia. They set up summer territories where the leaf canopy overhead inhibits underbrush and provides deep leaf litter hosting plenty of invertebrates. Extensive, uninterrupted forests with relatively closed canopies 50 to 70 feet above the ground seem ideal. Even fairly large forest patches of 250 to 2,000 acres may not be able to support Ovenbird populations unless larger forests are close by. Ovenbirds are less picky about their winter habitats. Ovenbirds eat mainly forest insects and other invertebrates: a range of adult beetles and larvae, ants, caterpillars, flies, and other insects. Most of these are hunted in leaf litter, some on leaves, and a few on bark or in the air. Parents feed ground beetles and larvae to nestlings.")

Like many brightly coloured robins of the family Petroicidae, it is sexually dimorphic. Measuring 13.5 cm in length, the robin has a small, thin, black bill, and dark brown eyes and legs. The male has a distinctive white forehead spot and pink breast, with grey-black upperparts, wings and tail. The belly is white. The female has grey-brown plumage. The position of the pink robin and its Australian relatives on the passerine family tree is unclear; the Petroicidae are not closely related to either the European or American robins, but appear to be an early offshoot of the Passerida group of songbirds.

There are five or six subspecies differing in the extent of the underpart streaking.The lesser striped swallow has heavier and darker underparts striping, a deeper red rump, and a brighter head colour than the larger greater striped swallow.The lesser striped swallow builds a bowl-shaped mud nest with a tubular entrance on the underside of a suitable structure. The nest has a soft lining, and may be reused in later years. The nest may be built in a cave, under a rock overhang or a tree branch. This species has benefited from its willingness to use buildings, bridges, culverts and similar structures. Given the choice, it will select a high nest site.The eggs are glossy white sometimes with a few brown spots; three eggs are a typical clutch. Incubation is by the female alone for 14–16 days to hatching. Both parents then feed the chicks. Fledging takes another 17–19 days, but the young birds will return to the nest to roost for a few days after their first flight.")

In spring, these birds are to be found in a marsh or slough where the surrounding water offers safety but often serves to limit the nesting habitat, resulting in crowding. A number of males are always in a display flight, head stooped, their feet and tail drooped, their wings beating slowly, in an accentuated manner. Some quarrel with their neighbors over boundaries; others fly off to feed. Approaching predators get mobbed by bunches of Yellow-headed blackbirds and any neighboring Red-winged blackbirds, nesting in the drier cattails. During summer, this species migrates north to go to the west-central areas of the United States and Canada. Its range extends to central-interior British Columbia in the far west, then directly south to the central-interior west coast and on to northeastern Baja California. In the east, the range runs from western Ontario to the north of Missouri. In winter, it is found from Texas to California and also in Mexico and as a casual visitor in Costa Rica. These birds inhabit freshwater marshes in the summer. They especially like to live amongst tule, cattails, and bulrush. At the time of migration and during winter they occur in open cultivated areas, in fields, and in pastures.")
